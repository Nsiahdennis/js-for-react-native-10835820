DcIT202 mobile up development basically is grooming us in the field of computer science.
this is my student identification number 10835820
Explanaton base on the various taskes 
in the task 1,there is function called  processArray which takes an array of numbers as an argument.
it uses the  map mrethod to iterate over each eelment in the array and  the is iterated repeatedly to check if the condition is met

Task 2
inside the   map  function , it checks  if the number is an even or an odd using the modular operator%
if the number is even  (num % 2 ===0). it square the number(num *num) and if the number is odd , it trppled the number (num*3)
The map method returns a new array with the process numbers
Function to format an array of strings based on a corresponding array of numbers.
  Capitalizes strings if the corresponding number is even.
 Converts strings to lowercase if the corresponding number is odd.

 Task 3 
 const originalNames = ["Kwame", "Kofi", "Akua"];
   const modifiedNames = ["KWAME", "KOFI", "AKUA"];
   this method has been able to takes the string and make it modification to match the originalNames
